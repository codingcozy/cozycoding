Managing a team, you quickly realize a stark difference in feedback loops. It's slow and unclear. After making decisions or changes, it's tough to determine success. The impact might only surface months later, leaving you unsure of the outcome's cause.

This shift is particularly noticeable for managers with a software engineering background. In tech, feedback is immediate and precise. You write code, run it, and see the outcome—thanks to tools like type checkers and automated testing, confirming the quality of your work.

The silver lining? The ambiguous feedback for managers and leaders can improve. Just as tech innovates feedback processes, leadership has its own tool: the one-on-one meeting. These interactions act as unit tests for leadership effectiveness, offering valuable insights for growth and development.
